# Data-Visualization-Using-Tableau
1. Applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to Real-World Business Context
Explored and interpreted a real estate dataset with multiple variables including sale price, square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, neighborhood, and zoning types.

Gained hands-on experience identifying outliers, patterns, and anomalies in complex data to support strategic decision-making.

2. Data Visualization & Dashboard Design with Tableau
Designed interactive dashboards using Tableau to effectively communicate insights such as:

Distribution of house prices

Neighborhood-wise variation in property features

Correlation between interior size and sale price

Impact of commercial zones (RC - 1) on property value

Emphasized clarity, consistency, and usability in dashboard layouts using appropriate chart types, filters, and color schemes.

3. Developed Business-Centric Insights
Identified key drivers of property value, such as square footage and neighborhood characteristics.

Highlighted high-demand areas and under/overpriced segments, helping refine the company's pricing strategy.

Analyzed how property taxes and zoning types influence buyer behavior and market value.

4. Enhanced Storytelling with Data
Created a structured storyboard with multiple dashboards, culminating in a Summary and Recommendations Dashboard tailored for senior management.

Practiced translating complex data findings into clear, actionable business recommendations, such as:

Prioritizing certain neighborhoods for listings

Adjusting pricing models based on feature impact

Enhancing the House Recommendation System with location-based filters

5. Business and Analytical Thinking Integration
Strengthened ability to think like a data-driven business analyst: not just answering what the data shows, but why it matters to the business.

Learned to align data insights with broader goals like customer satisfaction, competitive pricing, and inventory optimization.

✅ Final Takeaway:
This project enhanced both technical skills in Tableau and analytical thinking needed for real-world data science and business analytics roles. It also provided valuable experience in delivering executive-ready insights, supporting a critical business function—refining a real estate recommendation system.
